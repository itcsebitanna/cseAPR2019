 
AIM: To write a C program to implement File Allocation concept using the technique indexed allocation Technique..
ALGORITHM:
Step 1: Start the Program
 Step 2:Obtain the required data through char and int datatypes.
 Step 3:Enter the filename,index block.
 Step 4: Print the file name index loop.
 Step 5:Fill is allocated to the unused index blocks
Step 6: This is allocated to the unused linked allocation.
 Step 7: Stop the execution.
 PROGRAM CODING:
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
char a[10];
 int i,ib,cib[10];
 printf("\n enter the file name:");
scanf("%s",a);
printf("\n index block:");
scanf("%d",&ib);
 for(i=1;i<=5;i++)
{
 printf("\n enter the child of index block %d:",i);
 scanf("%d",&cib[i]);
}
 printf("\n the list of files\t index block\n");
printf("%s\t\t %d",a,ib);
 printf("\n the above file utiltization index block of child blocks followin\t");
printf("\n"); for(i=1;i<=5;i++)
 {
 printf("%d\t\t",cib[i]);
}
printf("\n");
}
 RESULT: Thus the program was executed successfully.
OUTPUT:
 Enter the name:Testing
 Index block:19
 Enter the child of index block 1:9
 Enter the child of index block 2:16 Enter the child of index block 3:1
 Enter the child of index block 4:10
 Enter the child of index block 5:25
 The list of files index block Testing 19
 The above file utilization index block of child blocks following:
 9 16 1 10 25
 RESULT: Thus the program was executed successfully.
