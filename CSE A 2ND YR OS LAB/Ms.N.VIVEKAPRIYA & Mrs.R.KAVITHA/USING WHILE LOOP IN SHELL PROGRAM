 AIM: To write a shell program to print the number from 1 to 10 using while loop.
 ALGORITHM :
Step 1 : Include the necessary header files.  
Step 2 : Define the buffer size as 1024.
Step 3 : Get the file name which has been created already.
Step 4 : Open the file in read mode.
 Step 5 :.Read the contents of the file and store it in the buffer.
Step 6 : Print the contents stored in the buffer.
Step 7 : Close the file.
 PROGRAM CODING:
#!/bin/bash
a=1 while  [  $a  -lt  11 ]
 do
 echo  "$a" a=`expr  $a  +  1`
 done
 
OUTPUT:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
RESULT: Thus the program was executed successfully
