AIM: To write a shell program to solve arithmetic operation.
 ALGORITHM :
Step 1 : Include the necessary header files.
  Step 2 : get the inpu.
Step3 : perform the arithmetic calculation.
 Step 4 : print the result.
Step 5 :stop the exeution.
 PROGRAM CODING:
#!/bin/bash echo
  "enter the a vale"
 read   a echo   
"enter b value"
read   b
c=`expr   $a   +   $b`
 echo   "sum:"
$c c=`expr   $a   -   $b`
 echo   "sub:"
$c c=`expr   $a   \*   $b`
 echo   "mul:"$c c=`expr   $a   /   $b`
echo   "div:"$c
OUTPUT:
 Enter  the a vale 10
 Enter  b value 50
sum:60
sub:-40
 mul:500
div:0
RESULT: Thus the program was executed successfully
