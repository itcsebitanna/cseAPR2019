AIM: To write a c program to implement the first come first serve without arrival TIME CPU scheduling algorithm  
 ALGORITHM:
Step 1: Create the number of process.
Step 2: Get the ID and Service time for each process.  
Step 3: Initially, Waiting time of first process is zero and Total time for the first process is the starting time of that process.  
Step 4: Calculate the Total time and Processing time for the remaining processes.
 Step 5: Waiting time of one process is the Total time of the previous process.
Step 6: Total time of process is calculated by adding Waiting time and Service  time.  
Step 7: Total waiting time is calculated by adding the waiting time for lack process.
Step 8: Total turn around time is calculated by adding all total time of each process.
 Step 9: Calculate Average waiting time by dividing the total waiting time by total  number of process.  
Step 10: Calculate Average turn around time by dividing the total time by the number of process.
 Step 11: Display the result.
 PROGRAM CODING:
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
 {
 int n,b[10],t=0,i,w=0,r=0,a=0;
 float avg,avg1;
 printf("\nEnter number of processes:");
 scanf("%d",&n);  
printf("\nEnter the burst times : \n");
 for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
scanf("%d",&b[i]);
 printf("\n Gantt chart ");
 for(i=1;i<=n;i++) printf("P%d\t",i);
 printf("\n\nProcess BurstTime WaitingTime TurnaroundTime\n");  
for(i=1;i<=n;i++)  
{
 t=t+w;
  r=r+b[i];
 printf("P%d\t\t%d\t\t%d\t\t%d\t\t\n",i,b[i],w,r);
 w=w+b[i];
a=a+r;
}
avg=(float)t/n;
 avg1=(float)a/n;
 printf("\n Average WaitingTime is %f",avg);
printf("\n Average TurnaroundTime is %f\n",avg1);
return(0);
}
  OUTPUT:
 Enter number of processes : 3 Enter the burst times :
 24

 Average WaitingTime is 17.666666
Average TurnaroundTime is 28.333334  
 RESULT: Thus the program is executed
