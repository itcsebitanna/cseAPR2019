AIM:
       To write a C program to simulate the operation of  “ls” commands in Unix.  
ALGORITHM :  
Step 1 : Include the necessary header files.  
Step 2 : Define the buffer size as 1024.
Step 3 : Get the file name which has been created already.
Step 4 : Open the file in read mode.
Step 5 :.Read the contents of the file and store it in the buffer.
Step 6 : Print the contents stored in the buffer.
Step 7 : Close the file.  
PROGRAM CODING:
#include<stdio.h>
#include<dirent.h>
int main()
{
struct dirent **namelist;
int n,i;
char pathname[100];
scanf("%s",&pathname);
getcwd(pathname);
n=scandir(pathname,&namelist,0,alphasort);
if(n<0) printf("Error");
else
for(i=0;i<n;i++)
printf("%s\n",namelist[i]->d_name);
}  
RESULT:  Thus the program was executed successfully
